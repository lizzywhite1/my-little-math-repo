# my-little-math-repo
A little repository which contains a range of functions I have created from scratch in Python. 

As I go into my third year of university and I have become very interested in the world of ML, I wanted to ensure that my maths fundamentals (mostly first year stuff) are up to scratch. So as I have been flicking through textbooks, I have been asking myself whether I could implement certain things from scratch. Obviously with all the scientific libraries out there, there is no need to do this in practicality, but I enjoy understanding what is going on under the hood.
